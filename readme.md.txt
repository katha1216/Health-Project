This project focuses on transforming raw healthcare data into meaningful, high-quality features that can be effectively used for predictive modeling and clinical decision support. The dataset contains patient demographics, vital signs, medical history, lab test results, doctor notes, and visit information. Since healthcare data is often noisy, incomplete, and heterogeneous, feature engineering becomes a critical step in improving model performance and extracting clinical insights.

Through systematic preprocessing and feature engineering, this project creates new enriched attributes such as BMI, blood pressure indicators, risk factors, visit frequencies, glucose categories, and log-transformed medical measurements. The process also includes encoding of categorical medical terms, handling missing or skewed values, and normalization of numerical records.

The engineered dataset is prepared for downstream machine-learning tasks such as disease prediction, patient risk stratification, or hospital readmission analysis. The project demonstrates how advanced data processing techniques can convert complex patient information into actionable data representations that support better healthcare analytics.
